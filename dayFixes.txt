    [FIX] Sprites do not move when you change their scale in y. They still do in x.
    [FIX] Sprites size does not depend on their wall's size anymore.
    [FIX] Player highest sect fixed when moving the playing in the editor. Was causing a crash.
    [FIX] Sector x_max updated when vertices are moved. Could not select a sector correctly if x_max was changed but not updated.
    [FIX] Map does not move when you ctrl + s anymore.
    [DEL] No need to add an empty sprite to each wall anymore.
    [MOD] Textures align is faster.
    [FIX] Keys delay when selecting textures fixed.
    [FIX] Wall width updated when moving vertices (so its texture scale is not affected by it anymore).
    [FIX] Sector removal was crashing. Floor and ceiling scale/pos correctly init when creating a sector.
    [ADD] Sprites scale and pos are independant from their texture.
    [ADD] Wall sprites keys (scale and pos).
    [FIX] Selection is cleaner + skybox selection fixed.
    [FIX] Textures scale whith tab off was not working.
    [MOD] Editor 3d mode and game keys split. No need to have tab on to scale textures.
